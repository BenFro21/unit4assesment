//The next step we need to do is to create our Data Transfer Objects, or DTOâ€™s.
// As a general rule, it is not a good idea to send your entities outside of the application or within the application context itself because the entities themselves are tied to the Database,
// and changes that can potentially open your application up to vulnerabilities or accidental changes to your data.
// To avoid passing around the Entity object itself, we create lightweight copies of them solely for the purpose of transferring the data stored within the object.
